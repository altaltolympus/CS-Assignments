                I like Dungeons and Dragons, but I don't always remember all the classes. 
                To help with this, I created a webpage with the names of every class, as well as a short description.
            </p>
            <img src="wireframes/alt1.jpg" alt="A wireframe for ALT1">
            <p>
                The plan was to present the names of each class in boxes laid out in a grid, and for a description to appear when the user clicked on the name. 
                This description would disappear when the user clicked again.
                I decided to use flexbox in CSS to lay out the grid rather than CSS grid itself, because this would allow me to effectively resize items and add new ones like I wanted to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started by finding short descriptions of each class on the official Dungeons & Dragons website and pasting them into a file. 
                I then used flexbox as I had intended to create two columns on the webpage and laid out the boxes with the names of each class in those columns.
            </p>
            <p>
                I initially planned to add the descriptions using JavaScript, but encountered the problem of not knowing how to write any JavaScript at all.
                I had planned to solve this problem by learning enough JavaScript to do what was needed, but this ended up taking too long to complete within the allocated timeframe.
                Therefore, I changed my plan. Rather than clicking on the classes to reveal the description, I decided to show them after hovering over it instead.
                This can be done using CSS without any JavaScript, and was therefore perfectly possible for me to accomplish.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this challenge overcome, I took colour and design inspiration from the Dungeons & Dragons website and added in the descriptions until finally the website was functionong as intended.
                If I were to improve this project, I would try to revisit the original plan to use JavaScript, and add more mechanical details of each class.
                However, for the moment, the page will do fine as it is.

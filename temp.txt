Question 15
(a) Staged
    -Problems in the code will be spotted early on and fixed while it is still cheap to do so
    -Any developers who join midway through the project will be better able to understand what's happening
(b)
Designer:
    -Produces design documentation
    -Amends documentation as necessary
Tester:
    -Carries out tests
    -Ensures that test results are well-documented
(c) (i)
The first interface is much more sophisticated, including images and a record of each game. It also features depictions of each move in rock, paper, scissors on the selector buttons, making it more suited to an international user base.
By contrast, the second interface is very simple, only having a move selector, a display for the computer's move and the result of the last game, a score counter, and a play button. It would be better suited to less powerful machines as it is less graphically complex and memory-intensive.
(ii)
-An adaptive technology that could be used here is a dictation software to allow the user to say their next move aloud rather than clicking buttons.
-Another is a screen reader that could read out the result of the game to the user.
